# 📚 Python Learning Modules — by Iradukunda Fils

Welcome to the **Libs** repository — a curated library of beginner-to-advanced Python tutorials, shared in both **Kinyarwanda** and English. This project supports learners following the **Digital Rwanda** YouTube channel and includes practical code examples for data science, visualization, and algorithmic thinking.

## 🧠 Main File

### ▶️ `toutorial.py`

This file is the **starting point** of your Python journey. It contains:
- Core explanations on **NumPy**, `np.dtype`, memory usage, and character encoding
- Practical demonstrations in **Kinyarwanda**
- Comments and print statements that walk you through each step

This will grow to include more content as you progress.

## 🔍 Modules You'll Learn in This Repository

### ✅ Current Focus
- 🧮 NumPy: `np.dtype`, `frompyfunc`, arrays, ufuncs
- 📈 Matplotlib: plotting data in graphs (coming soon)

### 📘 Upcoming Topics
